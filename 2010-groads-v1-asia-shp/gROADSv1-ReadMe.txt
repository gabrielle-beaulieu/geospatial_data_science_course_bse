Global Roads Open Access Data Set, Version 1 (gROADSv1)

February 7, 2013

DESCRIPTION

This archive contains the Global Roads Open Access Data Set, Version 1 (gROADSv1), developed under the auspices of the CODATA Global Roads Data Development Task Group. The data set combines the best available public domain roads data (i.e., “open data”) by country into a global roads coverage, using the UN Spatial Data Infrastructure Transport (UNSDI-T) version 2 as a common data model. Documentation and metadata for this data set are available on the SEDAC gROADSv1 web site:
http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/groads-global-roads-open-access-v1


ACCESSING THE DATA

The data may be downloaded via the World Wide Web at http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/groads-global-roads-open-access-v1

The data are available as compressed zipfiles of Esri file geodatabases (global and regional) or shapefiles (regional only). Downloaded files need to be uncompressed in a single folder using either WinZip (Windows file compression utility) or similar application before they can be accessed by your GIS software package. Users should expect an increase in the size of downloaded data after decompression. 

Extents of Regional tiles:					
					
Region		lonW	lonE	latN	latS
Africa		 -32	  72	  42	 -52
Americas	-180	 -32	  86	 -58
Asia (multipart polygon)

OceaniaWest	-180	-128	  29	 -58
OceaniaEast	  90	 180	  29	 -58


The data are stored in geographic coordinates of decimal degrees based on the World Geodetic System spheroid of 1984 (WGS84).

Users should consult the gROADSv1 documentation for complete information on the data set.


CODEBOOK

gROADSv1 used the UN Spatial Data Infrastructure Transport (UNSDI-T) version 2 as a common data model. The following are the field codes and full names, with sample coding. It should be mentioned that owing to the variability in source data, many of the fields could not be properly coded.
